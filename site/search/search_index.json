Reference for Dhrupad can also be found in the classical text \"Natyashastra\". Dhrupad can be presented by both, vocals & instruments, infact there has been a long tradition for Vani (Vocals) and Veena (String Instruments) to accompany each other. Methodology \u00b6 Dhrupad is presented in four distinct parts, all forming a continuous patterns and part of the entire presentation, the four parts are - Alaap - This includes slow exploration of the raag, this is also knows as \"Raag Vistaar\", meaning you explore the beauty of the raag by expanding one note at a time. Jod - The alaap is followed by patterns which are relatively medium paced. Jhalla - Jod is followed by fast patterns while maintaining the boundaries of the raag. Bandish/Gat - Finally, the presentation is concluded by bandish or gat. Characteristic \u00b6 What makes Dhrupad rather unique is, along with the external expression it also helps to explore your inner dimension, on the surface the music may sound simple or subtle, but it requires a great deal of inner exploration to find the right expressions. Simplicity can rather be very complicated and also it takes a great deal of efforts to present in a way which feels profoundly simple yet graceful and powerful. Often, Dhrupad is a form of lifestyle, the essence of music and your daily life go together. Naad Yoga \u00b6 This has been a favourite topic of discussions and research for numerous years, some associate it with occult yogic practices, some associate it with something mystical, some associate it with spirituality from music, etc. So lets try to clarify a lot of misconceptions and understand what it really means. \"Naad Yoga\" consists of two words \"Naad\" and \"Yoga\" , lets try to explore them word by word - Yoga - \u00b6 Yoga has to be understood first as it form the basis of discussion - \u092f\u094b\u0917\u0936\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094b\u0927\u0903 \u0965\u0968\u0965 yoga\u015b citta-v\u1e5btti-nirodha\u1e25 \u2014\u2009Yoga Sutras 1.2 What it means is, in essence, Yoga is the natural cessation (nirodha\u1e25) of the modifications (v\u1e5btti) of the mind (citta) . There are various methodologies of achieving this state, e.g Ashtang Yoga, Hath Yoga, Naad Yoga, etc. Naad \u00b6 Naad literally means \"Sound\", so essentially Naad Yoga is one form out of many methodologies to achieve \"Yog\" (State of Yoga). Naad Yoga primarily explores the medium of sound (Naad) to reach this ultimate goal. Rasa \u00b6 Rasa refers to \"sentiments\" or \"mood\" and it forms an integral part of Dhrupad presentation, rasa comes in various flavours. According to the N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra chapter 6.15, the eight sentiments (rasa) recognized in drama are as follows: 1. \u015b\u1e5b\u1e45g\u0101ra (Decorative or erotic), 2. h\u0101sya (Humor), 3. karu\u1e47a (Pity), 4. raudra (Furious), 5. v\u012bra (Heroic), 6. bhay\u0101naka (Terrible), 7. b\u012bbhatsa (Odious), 8. adbhuta (Marvellous) While Dhrupad explores all types of rasa, but often h\u0101sya (Humor), bhay\u0101naka (Terrible) and b\u012bbhatsa (Odious) are left out for obvious reasons. This is one aspect that makes Dhrupad or Indian Classical Music rather unique, the artist is free to improvise and explore any rasa while maintaining the sanity of the raag. Thus any one raaga can be often presented in multiple rasas, all depending on the artist and every expression is equally valid!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"","title":"Welcome!"},{"location":"#dhrupad-an-introduction","text":"Dhrupad is the oldest and the most ancient form of Indian Classical Music , it finds its origin in the vedic culture around the Indian sub-continent.

Again the usage of the term Samv\u0101di may change but the interval representing Samvad\u0101 or consonance can never change i.e. the interval of Sa-Pa (fifth) and Sa-Ma (fourth) can never change. Gr\u0101ma system \u00b6 The Gr\u0101ma system which is based on the two main Sa-Pa & Sa-Ma Samv\u0101da is the science of the musical scales as developed by our seers. The Gr\u0101ma system can also be taken as the grammar of our musical scales that embodies certain fundamental principals which hold good for all times and places. Bharata, the earliest extend authority on our music, speaks of two Gr\u0101mas, Shadja-Gr\u0101ma and Madhyama-Gr\u0101ma. Shadja-Gr\u0101ma \u00b6 Shadja-Gr\u0101ma is based on Shadja-Pancham-Samv\u0101da. All the notes in this Gr\u0101ma have the mutual Samv\u0101di interval of Shadja-Pancham-Bhava which is thirteen shrutis interval or sa-pa, redha, ga-ni, ma-sa. The characteristic feature of Madhyama-Gr\u0101ma is Reshab-Pancham-Samv\u0101da. This Re-Pa Samv\u0101da is not there in Shadja-Gr\u0101ma. Because Reshab is trishrutic in Shadja-Gr\u0101ma, it has a ten-shruti interval with Pancham and thus no Samv\u0101da is possible. Madhyama-Gr\u0101ma \u00b6 In the Madhyama-Gr\u0101ma however the Shadja-Pancham-Samv\u0101da is violated by establishing Reshab-Pancham Samv\u0101da. In other words, the Pancham of Madhyama-Gr\u0101ma is at 12 shruti interval from Shadja which is not a Samv\u0101di interval and thus it has a Samv\u0101di interval of 9 shrutis from Reshab. In Shadja-Gr\u0101ma we arrive at the perfect fifth and in Madhyama-Gr\u0101ma we reduce this perfect fifth so as to make it the perfect fourth of trishrutic Reshab. Pr\u0101mana Shruti \u00b6 So now the difference between Pancham of Shadja-Gr\u0101ma and that of Madhyama-Gr\u0101ma comprises the Pr\u0101mana Shruti or the standard shruti. In the mathematical calculation this difference comes to 81/80. This is Bharata\u2019s simple method of arriving at the subtle interval of Pr\u0101mana Shruti through the system of two Gr\u0101mas which are based on Samv\u0101da or consonance.","title":"Grama"},{"location":"articles/grama/#the-ancient-grama-system-the-concept-of-pramana-standard-shruti","text":"(Ustad Z M Dagar in his natural state) Generally speaking musical forms, styles, names & terminology change but there are certain fundamental musical principals which never change i.e. the law of consonance or Samv\u0101da.
