## Indian School of Dhrupad

We are undertaking all community initiatives to promote Dhrupad under the banner of **"Indian School of Dhrupad"**, it has been setup with only one intention, i.e to promote Dhrupad and allied art forms.

Since, its a community driven initiative we would love if you could get involved in our activities and help promote music. Participation is very easy, you can write to us at dhrupadnetofficial [at] gmail com , if you have any idea or feedback or get involved with our on-going activities.

We are also in the process of collecting audio/video archives and starting a dedicated YouTube channel, and we would be more than happy to receive any such content.
